# You can use this document to check your R submission.
# (Although this is just a wrapper around the `evaluate_submission.R` file,
#   which you can also call using `Rscript evaluate_submission.R` from the terminal).
#
# To skip code style checks, set the `SKIP_STYLE` variable to `TRUE`.
# To restrict checks to single exercises, set `EXERCISES`-vector to
# something, e.g. `EXERCISES = c("1.1", "1.4")`. Note that restricting to individual
# exersises results in a more detailed error description.
